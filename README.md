# Architectural Patterns
Samples of Architectural Patterns for the Lecture on Software Architecture at UTN-FRC.

* All samples are written in vanilla JavaScript to keep it simple and without dependencies.

* To run the samples, just clone the repository and run the .html file in each of the folders in any browser.

* Although samples uses quite basic JavaScript and HTML API I have only tested them in Chrome. So, some things may not work in other browsers.
